# Titeknit

# Inspiration
In this trying time, many families and seniors are unable to travel to get necessary supplies and groceries from the store because they do not have personal vehicles and there is lack of public transportation. In addition, many of us have extra items stored in our homes.

# What it does
Titeknit is an IOS App which allows users to help others in their neighborhood by selling excess items or receiving necessary items by creating a wishlist which notifies them of available listings and delivers those that match their needs.

# Challenges we ran into
Throughout this process, we did a lot of research and refining. Halfway through making the app, we realized that volunteers will not be able to travel too far to deliver the items, so we implemented the ZipCode Api to locate listings within the radius they specified they can pickup or deliver. In addition, we ran into a multitude of errors due to Xcodes recent updates. When testing our app, it would not sideload because of the recent XCode update. Eventually, we got it running and are proud to have a delivered, working prototype.

# We learned
We learned how to utilize Firebase Database, Stripe Payment API, Zipcode Api, Apple’s CLLocation Library, Swift’s UI Tools, protocol & delegates, push notifications, and node.js backend.

# What's next for TiteKnit
Next, we will advance our volunteer page by including tasks to complete in order to deliver the items to and from the homes that need the items. Thank you!
